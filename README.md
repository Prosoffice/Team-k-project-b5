FRIENDLY DOCUMENTATION


The Facebook mock-up developed in this repository is a strict DESKTOP screen optimized webpage, we decided to adopt the exact same approach the real Facebook practice, which is having different code bases and URLs for the Mobile and Desktop Screen sizes i.e m.facebook.com and facebook.com respectively. 

This essentially resulted to a css file with no media queries

Unfortunately we don't have a mobile view yet, but this is what we could put up with the timeframe given and resources available. We're sure to deliver the complete package  in a more friendly timeframe, including some finishing touches on the Desktop.

A big part of the lesson we learnt from doing this project was the efficacy and vitality of the four main Positioning attribute in CSS...it was quite difficult to understand by just watching the lecture videos but after this project...it's our new bread and butter.
